BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project!

This program counts the number of words in a book and returns a list of how many times all alphabetical characters appeared in said book. 

To run bookbot you will need:
1. Both the main.py and the stats.py files
2. A folder with the full text of your books. The program currently uses a folder called books, but you can replace that with your own. Books can be found at [Gutenberg.org](https://www.gutenberg.org/).
3. A terminal. Bookbot is currently a CLI program.
